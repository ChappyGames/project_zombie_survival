  weaponName: Beta Tomcat
  weaponDescription: A small pocket pistol popular for concealed carrying, the Tomcat
    was a great deterrent against would-be robbers due to its size, making it easily
    concealable. However, it lacks the stopping power for killing zombies en masse,
    and thus it's better known as a desperate last-resort weapon.
